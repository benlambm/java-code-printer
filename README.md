# java-project-printer :coffee: :page_facing_up: 
This repository contains a Java utility named JavaProjectPrinter that helps in scanning and collating the content of all .java files in a given directory and its subdirectories into a single text file. This project is open-source and licensed under the MIT License, which means you are free to use, modify, and distribute the code as you wish, as long as you include the original copyright and license notice in any copy of the software/source. I welcome contributions through pull requests and encourage you to report any issues on the Issues board.

## Usage :rocket:
To use the program, simply copy and paste the file JavaProjectPrinter.java into your desired Java project folder. Then, open any Terminal app at that location and execute the following command:

`java JavaProjectPrinter.java`

This command will run the program, and you should see the collated content of all .java files in a new file named "code.txt" in the same directory.

Alternatively, you can open and Run the file in any IDE of your choice. Just copy the JavaProjectPrinter.java file anywhere in your Project and run it. 

## System Requirements :coffee:

You must have Java SE 17 or higher installed correctly on your computer. Verify if needed by running the `java --version` command.

## Use Cases :bulb:

1. Code Review: Quickly generate a single file containing all the Java code in a project, making it easier to share and review the code with your team members.
2. Documentation: Generate a comprehensive code file to include in your project documentation, providing a complete overview of the codebase.
3. Backup: Create a single file backup of your Java project's source code, making it easier to store and manage.
4. Code Analysis: Generate a single file containing all the Java code in a project, making it easier to perform static code analysis or search for specific patterns or issues.
