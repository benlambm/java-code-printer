# java-code-printer :coffee: :page_facing_up: 
This repository contains a Java utility named JavaCodePrinter that helps in scanning and collating the content of all .java files in a given directory and its subdirectories into a single text file. This project is open-source and licensed under the MIT License, which means you are free to use, modify, and distribute the code as you wish, as long as you include the original copyright and license notice in any copy of the software/source. I welcome contributions through pull requests and encourage you to report any issues on the Issues board.

## Usage :rocket:
To use the program, simply copy and paste the file JavaProjectPrinter.java into your desired Java project folder. Then, open any Terminal app at that location and execute the following command:

`java JavaCodePrinter.java`

This command will run the program, and you should see the collated content of all .java files in a new file named "code.txt" in the same directory.

Alternatively, you can open and Run the file in any IDE of your choice. Just copy the JavaCodePrinter.java file anywhere in your Project and run it. 

## System Requirements :coffee:

You must have Java SE 17 or higher installed correctly on your computer. Verify if needed by running the `java --version` command.

## Use Cases :bulb:
_Disclaimer_ Always consider the privacy and security implications of sharing/exchanging an entire project's source code online. Only use for Personal or Open-Source Projects!!
1. __Learning & Teaching__: For educators and students, compiling all the .java files into one file can help in reading and sharing the code in different applications.
2. __Code Portability for Coding Assistance__: Share and send your entire Project's Java source code to a teacher, tutor, or even an AI coding assistant. No need to try to copy multiple files at a time when exchanging source code. 
3. __Easier Code Metrics__: By collating all the .java files, developers can run metrics on the whole project (e.g., lines of code, number of methods/classes) to get an overview of the code's size and complexity.
4. __Quick Project Overview and Summarization__: Quickly produces a single file containing all the Java code in a project, making it easier to share and review the code with your team members. For developers who want a snapshot of what's happening in the entire codebase, a single file can provide a fast overview, especially if the developer is new to the project. A single text view can be more easily summarized by various AI services as well for getting up to speed.
5. __Integration with Other Tools__: This utility could be integrated with other tools to provide features like code formatting, highlighting, or even converting the code into different output formats (e.g., PDF).
6. __Audit & Compliance__: For organizations and individuals that need to review code for compliance with certain standards, having a consolidated view can simplify the audit process.
7. __Simple Text Backup__: Create a single Text file backup of your Java project's source code, like a snapshot in time. Note, however, it currently ONLY saves .java files.
