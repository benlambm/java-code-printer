# java-project-printer
This repository contains a Java utility named JavaProjectPrinter that helps in scanning and collating the content of all .java files in a given directory and its subdirectories into a single text file.

## Usage
To use the program, simply copy and paste the file JavaProjectPrinter.java into your desired Java project folder. Then, open any Terminal app at that location and execute the following command:

`java JavaProjectPrinter.java`

This command will run the program, and you should see the collated content of all .java files in a new file named "code.txt" in the same directory.

OR, you can open and Run the file in any IDE of your choice. 

## Prerequisites

You must have Java 17 installed correctly on your computer. Verify this by running the `java --version` command.
